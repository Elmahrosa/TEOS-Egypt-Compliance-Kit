## 🏛️ Constitutional Authority

This repository derives its authority from the
**International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)**:

https://github.com/Elmahrosa/International-Civic-Blockchain-Constitution

Any implementation or use must comply with ICBC and TESL.

## 📍 Repository Standing

This repository is the **official compliance and regulatory enforcement layer**
of the **TEOS / Elmahrosa Sovereign Stack**.

It translates **constitutional authority, national law, regulatory obligations,
and institutional policy** into **binding, enforceable system constraints**
applied across identity, banking, payments, AI, and civic digital infrastructure.

**Founder & Authority:** Elmahrosa International — TEOS Egypt  
**Founder:** Ayman Seif

## Constitutional Authority (Read First)

All legitimacy, governance, and enforcement authority derives from the  
**International Civic Blockchain Constitution** (single source of truth):

🔗 https://github.com/Elmahrosa/International-Civic-Blockchain-Constitution

Stewardship and lifecycle governance are anchored in:

- **TEOS-FORGE — Governance & Stewardship Anchor**  
  https://github.com/Elmahrosa/TEOS-FORGE

- **License Authority — TEOS Egypt Sovereign License (TESL)**  
  https://github.com/Elmahrosa/International-Civic-Blockchain-Constitution/blob/main/LICENSE

This repository operates **strictly subordinate** to the above authorities.

## Compliance Doctrine

**Born in Egypt for the World**  
*Built in Egypt. Engineered for Nations. Scaled for the World.*

Compliance is not optional.  
Law precedes protocol.  
Governance precedes execution.  
Human authority precedes automation.

This layer **enforces law and regulation**.  
It does not independently interpret, invent, or override legal authority.

Automation and AI **support enforcement** — they do not define it.

---

## What This Repository Is

**TEOS Egypt Compliance Kit** is the **jurisdictional enforcement layer** of TEOS.

It is responsible for:

- Mapping national laws and regulations into technical controls
- Enforcing regulatory requirements at runtime
- Blocking non-compliant execution paths
- Emitting audit-ready compliance evidence
- Enabling country-specific jurisdiction profiles
- Supporting regulated sovereign and institutional deployments

> No TEOS system may execute sovereign or regulated actions  
> without passing compliance checks defined in this repository.

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- Not a governance authority (see **TEOS-Governance**)
- Not a policy authoring body
- Not a legal advisory service
- Not a public, permissionless, or community rules engine

---

## Mandatory Enforcement Chain

All sovereign and regulated execution **must** follow this chain:

**Constitution**  
→ **TEOS-FORGE**  
→ **TEOS-Governance**  
→ **TEOS Egypt Compliance Kit**  
→ AI Guard / Auditor (decision support)  
→ Teos Sovereign System (execution backbone)  
→ APIs / SDKs / Services

Any bypass is **non-compliant, unauthorized, and invalid** within the TEOS ecosystem.

---

## Core Responsibilities

| Domain | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Regulatory Mapping | Laws → policies → enforceable controls |
| Jurisdiction Profiles | Country-specific regulatory configuration |
| Policy Enforcement | Runtime allow / block decisions |
| Compliance Gates | Mandatory pre-execution checks |
| Evidence Emission | Audit-ready logs and reports |
| Revocation Hooks | Immediate suspension on violation |

---

## Supported Use Cases

- National digital identity systems
- CBDC and regulated payment rails
- Civic and governmental blockchain infrastructure
- Government and municipal digital platforms
- UN / SDG-aligned digital public programs

---

## Core Principles

1. Law before automation  
2. Governance before execution  
3. Human authority before AI  
4. Accountability before scale  
5. Sovereignty before decentralization  

---

## Ecosystem Integration

This repository integrates under governance control with:
