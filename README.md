## Compliance Doctrine

**Born in Egypt for the World**  
*Built in Egypt. Engineered for Nations. Scaled for the World.*

Elmahrosa establishes governance first.  
Institutions enforce regulation.  
Technology executes under authority.

Compliance rules are **binding**, auditable, and enforceable.
Automation and AI **support enforcement**—they do not define law.
