## 🏛️ Strategic Standing
The **TEOS Compliance Kit** is the "Enforcement Arm" of the Elmahrosa Sovereign Stack. It translates constitutional authority, national laws (such as **Egypt’s Law 151/2020**), and regulatory mandates into machine-enforceable controls. 

It acts as a mandatory "Compliance Gate," ensuring that no identity is verified, no payment is processed, and no data is exchanged unless it meets the specific jurisdictional requirements of the host nation.

- **Mandate:** Jurisdictional mapping, runtime enforcement, and audit evidence emission.
- **Authority Level:** Jurisdictional Enforcement (Chain Position #3).
- **Core Principle:** Technology is the instrument of law, never its replacement.

## 📐 Standards & Framework Alignment
TEOS is engineered for global institutional interoperability. This kit includes pre-configured mappings for:

* **ISO/IEC 27001:** Information Security Management alignment.
* **NIST Risk Management Framework:** Control baselines for sovereign security.
* **GovStack v1.0:** Alignment with Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) interoperability models.
* **SDG Compliance:** Automated data markers for UN Sustainable Development Goal reporting.

## ✅ Core Functional Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Institutional Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Regulatory Mapping** | Converts complex legal text into binding technical "if-then" controls. |
| **Jurisdiction Profiles** | Allows the stack to be localized for specific national laws (e.g., Data Residency). |
| **Runtime Enforcement** | Real-time "Allow/Block" decisions for every execution path. |
| **Evidence Emission** | Generates "Justice-Grade" logs for national audit offices and regulators. |
| **Revocation Hooks** | Instantly suspends non-compliant processes upon a governance signal. |
