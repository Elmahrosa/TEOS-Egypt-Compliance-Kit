of the **TEOS / Elmahrosa Sovereign Stack**.

and institutional policy** into **binding, enforceable system constraints**
applied across identity, banking, payments, AI, and civic digital infrastructure.

## 🧭 Compliance Doctrine

**Born in Egypt for the World**  
*Built in Egypt. Engineered for Nations. Scaled for the World.*

Compliance is not optional.

- Law precedes protocol  
- Governance precedes execution  
- Human authority precedes automation  

This layer **enforces law and regulation**.  
It does **not** invent, reinterpret, or override legal authority.

AI and automation **support enforcement only**.

---

## ✅ What This Repository Is

**TEOS Egypt Compliance Kit** is the **jurisdictional enforcement layer** of TEOS.

It is responsible for:

- Mapping laws and regulations into technical controls
- Enforcing regulatory requirements at runtime
- Blocking non-compliant execution paths
- Emitting audit-ready compliance evidence
- Enabling country-specific jurisdiction profiles
- Supporting regulated sovereign and institutional deployments

> No TEOS system may execute regulated or sovereign actions  
> without passing compliance checks defined here.

---

## ❌ What This Repository Is Not

- ❌ A governance authority (see **TEOS-Governance**)
- ❌ A policy authoring body
- ❌ A legal advisory service
- ❌ A public or permissionless rules engine

## 🔗 Mandatory Enforcement Chain
